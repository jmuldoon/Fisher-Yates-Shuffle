# Instructions
Fisher-Yates Shuffle Implementation in C++ for a basic 52 card deck. This was nothing entirely fancy and not meant for actual play since it is not developed further than the shuffle itself. Meant for proof-of-concept. Will eventually like to do so as well in GO and benchmark the two performances.
